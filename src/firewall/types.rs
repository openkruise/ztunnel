//! Firewall rule types and data structures
//!
//! The structure mirrors Istio's RBAC rule model:
//! - A FirewallRule has multiple clauses (AND'd)
//! - Each clause has multiple matches (OR'd)
//! - Each match specifies L3/L4 fields to match against
//!
//! Backends (iptables, nftables) are responsible for expanding this structure
//! into their native format. nftables can use sets for OR'd values within a
//! dimension; iptables expands into one rule per combination.
